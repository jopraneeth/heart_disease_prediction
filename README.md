Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict heart disease using logistic regression.

Dependencies
The project requires Python libraries: numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Data Collection and Processing
Loading the Data: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Exploring the Data: The first and last few rows of the dataset are examined to understand its structure.
Dataset Dimensions: The number of rows and columns is checked.
Data Information: Information about the dataset, including column names and data types, is obtained.
Missing Values: The dataset is checked for any missing values.
Statistical Measures: Statistical measures like mean, standard deviation, etc., are described.
Target Variable Distribution: The distribution of the target variable (presence of heart disease) is checked.
Splitting the Features and Target
Features (X): All columns except the target.
Target (Y): The column indicating the presence of heart disease.
Splitting the Data into Training and Test Sets
The data is split into training and test sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.

Model Training
A logistic regression model is created and trained using the training data.

Model Evaluation
The model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and test data to ensure it performs well on unseen data.

Building a Predictive System
A predictive system is built to make predictions on new patient data by:

Input Data: Providing new patient data.
Data Preprocessing: Converting and reshaping the input data for prediction.
Prediction: Using the model to predict whether the person has heart disease and displaying the result.
This explanation covers the key steps and processes involved in the project, providing a clear understanding without diving into the code specifics.
